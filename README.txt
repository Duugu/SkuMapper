r3.2
	- Added a new key bind: Unselect waypoints
	- Tried to fix an issue with hyphens not working for filter terms
	- Fixed a bunch of errors with deselecting waypoints that could lead to lua errors

r3.1
	- Added a new key bind: Undo.
		That is to reverse the last action (create/delete waypoint, link, rename, select waypoints, etc.)
		The only exception is moving waypoints. That action can't be undone with the Undo shortcut.
		The Undo history stores up to 100 actions. If you're doing more than 100, the oldest will be removed. 
		The history will be cleared on logout/reload. So, you can undo 100 recent actions from the current session max.
		It is a complex feature. I have tested it, and it seems to work. However, issues are possible. Please carefully check if it is working as intended. 
		Please report any problem with the Undo feature asap. Thanks!
